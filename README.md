## Integrating AWS Services with Fly.io for Remix App

### Table of Contents

1. [Integrating AWS with Fly.io](#integrating-aws-with-flyio)
2. [Hosting on AWS](#hosting-on-aws)
3. [Blending the Two](#blending-the-two)
4. [Recommendations](#recommendations)

---

## Integrating AWS with Fly.io

### Considerations

1. **SDKs and APIs**

   - Utilize AWS SDKs or APIs within your app, deployed on Fly.io, to interact
     with AWS services.

2. **Security**

   - Securely store AWS credentials as environment variables or use services
     like AWS Secrets Manager.

3. **Networking**

   - Ensure network permissions and firewall settings on both sides (AWS and
     Fly.io) allow for necessary interactions.

4. **Data Transfer Costs**

   - Be aware that using AWS services while hosting elsewhere can incur
     additional data transfer costs.

5. **Monitoring**
   - AWS provides CloudWatch for detailed monitoring, but you may need multiple
     monitoring solutions for full observability.

---

## Hosting on AWS

### Considerations

1. **Unified Management**

   - Simplifies administration, scaling, and monitoring.

2. **Cost Optimization**

   - Lower internal data transfer costs and potential bundled service pricing.

3. **Integrated Services**

   - AWS services are tightly integrated with each other for seamless data and
     service flow.

4. **Vendor Lock-in**
   - AWS services often work best with each other, leading to potential vendor
     lock-in.

---

## Blending the Two

### Considerations

1. **Best of Both Worlds**

   - Use Fly.io for edge deployments and AWS for its rich ecosystem of services.

2. **Complexity**

   - May result in more complex system architecture and data flow.

3. **Cost Analysis**
   - Balancing resources across two platforms may require more stringent cost
     monitoring.

---

## Recommendations

1. If youâ€™re happy with Fly.io, you can easily integrate AWS services into your
   Fly.io-deployed application.

2. If you foresee the need for multiple, tightly-integrated AWS services,
   consider migrating to AWS.

## Todo list

- [] develop CRUD API for all data models
- [] squash dev commits to eliminate deploy testing litter
- [] configure eslint to order imports akin to CI
- [] navbar dropdown icons
- [] find out SQL join for user -> roles
- [] add user nav config to conditionally render nav items
- [] split root layout into separate components
- [] use [open library](https://covers.openlibrary.org/w/id/6979861-M.jpg) for
  book cover images; create a service that fetches them on upload
- [] use goodreads api to add descriptions to added books; create a service that
  fetches them on upload
- [] build out concept of a "suggest me a book" based on reading/swap history.
  Is there an api for this?
- [] research: can the app be integrated with goodreads accounts?
- [] BUG: books index calls loader many times, repeating the same if logging out
  from that page. Why?
- [] book list can have author/genre/condition link to a search page revealing
  more of the same
- [] list pages need filters
- [] research: can we integrate with a courier service, printing delivery
  labels, organising book pick ups etc
- [] why do the constants not hot reload on change?
- [] add meta functions to all routes
- [] community/history models/api
- [] about page model/api
- [] welcome index model/api
- [x] deleting book search string creates an infinite loop of requests that I
      think remix eventually halts; how can I circumvent this? On every change
      in search term, the loader should only run once. Required revalidation
      prevention!
- [] passport.js for SSOs
- [] convert prisma to SQL statements
- [] use
