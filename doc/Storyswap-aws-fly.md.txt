## Integrating AWS with Fly.io

### Considerations

1. **SDKs and APIs**
   - Utilize AWS SDKs or APIs within your app, deployed on Fly.io, to interact with AWS services.
  
2. **Security**
   - Securely store AWS credentials as environment variables or use services like AWS Secrets Manager.

3. **Networking**
   - Ensure network permissions and firewall settings on both sides (AWS and Fly.io) allow for necessary interactions.

4. **Data Transfer Costs**
   - Be aware that using AWS services while hosting elsewhere can incur additional data transfer costs.

5. **Monitoring**
   - AWS provides CloudWatch for detailed monitoring, but you may need multiple monitoring solutions for full observability.

## Hosting on AWS

### Considerations

1. **Unified Management**
   - Simplifies administration, scaling, and monitoring.
  
2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Lower internal data transfer costs and potential bundled service pricing.

3. **Integrated Services**
   - AWS services are tightly integrated with each other for seamless data and service flow.

4. **Vendor Lock-in**
   - AWS services often work best with each other, leading to potential vendor lock-in.

## Blending the Two

### Considerations

1. **Best of Both Worlds**
   - Use Fly.io for edge deployments and AWS for its rich ecosystem of services.

2. **Complexity**
   - May result in more complex system architecture and data flow.

3. **Cost Analysis**
   - Balancing resources across two platforms may require more stringent cost monitoring.

## Recommendations

1. If youâ€™re happy with Fly.io, you can easily integrate AWS services into your Fly.io-deployed application.

2. If you foresee the need for multiple, tightly-integrated AWS services, consider migrating to AWS.

Given your background, integrating AWS services using AWS SDK for JavaScript should be straightforward.
